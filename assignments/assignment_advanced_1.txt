Clean up your ProbabilityDensityFunction class and create a fully-fledged
Python package.

--- Goal

Create a splrand Python package to generate univariate random numbers according
to a given distribution using splines.

The layout of the package should be (hopefully the names should be
self-explaining):

splrand
--- splrand/splrand
------ splrand/splrand/__init__.py
------ splrand/splrand/core.py
------ splrand/splrand/version.py
--- splrand/docs
------ splrand/docs/Makefile
------ splrand/docs/api.rst
------ splrand/docs/conf.py
------ splrand/docs/index.rst
------ splrand/docs/make.bat
------ splrand/docs/release_notes.rst
--- splrand/tests
------ splrand/tests/test_core.py
--- .travis.yml
--- LICENSE
--- README.md
--- requirements.txt


--- Specifications
- the package should have adequate unit tests
- the package should have continuus integration
- the package should have adequate documentation
- the documentation should be on readthedocs
- [optional] add a rudimentary release manager to automate the tagging process
