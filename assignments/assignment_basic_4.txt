Assignment #4 (October 7, 2021)


--- Goal
Create a ProbabilityDensityFunction class that is capable of throwing
preudo-random number with an arbitrary distribution.

(In practice, start with something easy, like a triangular distribution---the
initial debug will be easier if you know exactly what to expect.)


--- Specifications
- the signature of the constructor should be __init__(self, x, y), where
  x and y are two numpy arrays sampling the pdf on a grid of values, that
  you will use to build a spline
- [optional] add more arguments to the constructor to control the creation
  of the spline (e.g., its order)
- the class should be able to evaluate itself on a generic point or array of
  points
- the class should be able to calculate the probability for the random
  variable to be included in a generic interval
- the class should be able to throw random numbers according to the distribution
  that it represents
- [optional] how many random numbers do you have to throw to hit the
  numerical inaccuracy of your generator?
